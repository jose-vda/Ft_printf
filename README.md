# Ft_printf
ft_printf teaches you how to manage variable arguments, parse format strings, and print data in many forms â€” giving you a deep understanding of how text output actually works in C.

ft_printf is one of the most iconic projects at 42 School.
The goal is to recreate the behavior of the original C function printf() â€” a powerful function used to format and print text â€” but this time, you build it entirely from scratch.

This project pushes you to understand variadic functions (functions that take a variable number of arguments) and challenges you to handle different data types, formatting rules, and edge cases.
Youâ€™ll work with strings, integers, hexadecimal values, pointers, and more â€” all while learning how output formatting really works in C.

By the end, youâ€™ll have your own version of printf, called ft_printf, which behaves just like the original one (and sometimes even better ðŸ˜‰).
Itâ€™s a key step toward mastering C and preparing for more advanced projects that rely on robust, reusable code.
